          This educational module is designed to elevate your diagnostic skills in evaluating granulomatous diseases of the lung. The primary challenge in this area is not identifying a granuloma, but navigating the significant morphologic overlap between different etiologies.

        <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          Our goal is to move you from simple identification to integrated diagnostic reasoning, a crucial skill for both daily sign-out and board examinations.
